# ATTOM Aggregator Notebook

The Python notebook in this repo walks through the steps to read in, clean, spatially join, and aggregate home sales data from ATTOM for the 11-county Atlanta region. 

Note that because of data sharing agreement with ATTOM, we can not push address-level data to a public repo. Thus, the notebook is not reproducible with its current file paths but can be easily modified for local datasets.
